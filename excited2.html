  One thing I am learning and will continue to learn how to do is how to build a wall. So far I think that the wall is half done but it does have the main supporting parts and sheetrock on half of it. In the future during summer I think we are going to put insulation in it and then put the rest of the sheetrock on it.

The second thing I am excited to learn about is driving because I feel that I will be starting to drive in the next couple of weeks during summer. This gives me many opportunites to go places but since I am still learning I will have to drive with one of my parents and I probably wount drive to far from home.

This topic I am not so excited to learn but it can still be interesting to learn about. This topic is for my Conformation class where I am learning for a few years to be confirmed for my religion.
